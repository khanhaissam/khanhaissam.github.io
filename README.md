## 🧠 About Me

I'm a project manager with 14+ years of experience in engineering, digital transformation, and operations — currently leading continuous improvement and innovation solution projects at Air Liquide Japan.

Alongside my day job, I design and prototype practical AI tools that solve everyday industrial and project challenges — from heat safety alerts to Lean toolkits and weather-based construction planning.

I'm not a software engineer by training — but I love observing inefficiencies, rethinking systems, and building useful solutions (with no-code or low-code if needed!).
